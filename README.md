# Project-X

This is a project i am making for a school subject.
The subject is called Java but for some reason we must now program in python.
Who cares, i got a buggy ass game\n\nOh yeah this game will support multiplayer over TCP/IP or for normal people, you can stick your pc in a switch, connect other pc's and play together.
